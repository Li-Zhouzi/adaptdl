# AdaptDL

![](AdaptDLHorizLogo.png =250x)

AdaptDL is a resource-adaptive deep learning (DL) training and scheduling
framework. The goal of AdaptDL is to make distributed DL easy and efficient
in dynamic-resource environments such as shared clusters and public clouds.

Some core features offered by AdaptDL are:

-  Elastically schedule distributed DL training jobs in shared clusters.
-  Cost-aware resource auto-scaling in cloud computing environments (e.g. AWS).
-  Automatic batch size and learning rate scaling for distributed training.
